To export your PyQt6 serial GUI as a standalone app (so it can run without Python installed), you should use [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/). Here’s how you can do it:

---

### 1. Install PyInstaller

In your terminal, run:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

---

### 2. Package Your Script

From your project directory, run:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed GUI_Serial.py
```
- `--onefile`: Creates a single executable file.
- `--windowed`: Prevents a terminal window from opening with your GUI (for Windows/macOS; on Linux, it’s harmless).

---

### 3. Find Your Executable

After PyInstaller finishes, your standalone app will be in the `dist` folder:
```
dist/GUI_Serial
```
You can now run this file on any compatible system **without needing Python installed**.

---

### Notes

- On Linux, you may need to give execute permission:
  ```bash
  chmod +x dist/GUI_Serial
  ```
- For Windows, the output will be `GUI_Serial.exe`.
- If you use serial ports, make sure the target system has the necessary permissions (e.g., user in `dialout` group on Linux).

---

**Tip:**  
If you want to include an icon, add `--icon=youricon.ico` to the PyInstaller command.
